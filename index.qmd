Hello! I’m a Data Scientist at the Data & Analytics division of the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), where I build automated data pipelines, engineer reproducible workflows, and produce robust estimates that help countries track their progress toward child-related Sustainable Development Goals. My work sits at the intersection of data engineering and applied economic research — bringing together complex data systems to make evidence transparent and actionable.

Beyond my work at UNICEF, my academic portfolio focuses on the human capital research, particularly how socio-emotional skills shape young people’s transitions from school to work. I study how these skills interact with education, labor market outcomes, and broader socio-economic inequalities, with a special focus on youth in developing and transition economies.

I strongly believe that doing statistical analysis should go beyond numbers and data points; it's about understanding the stories these numbers tell and the lives they touch.

Welcome to my space.
