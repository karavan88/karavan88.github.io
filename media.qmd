*United Nations* — The coronavirus has claimed more than 2.5 million lives and infected almost 115 million people globally, but it's having a far wider impact on almost all of the world's children. The United Nations is trying to highlight the damage done by widespread school closures by giving it visual representation on the grounds of U.N. headquarters in New York, and urging countries to reopen classrooms.

UNICEF described the impact the shutdowns have had on school-age children as a “catastrophic education emergency” with “devastating consequences for children’s learning and well-being.”
