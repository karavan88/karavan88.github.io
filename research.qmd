## Overview

My research explores the intersection of education, labor markets, and human capital formation, with a particular focus on how cognitive and non-cognitive (socio-emotional) skills shape youth outcomes during the school-to-work transition. I am especially interested in understanding the mechanisms through which skills translate into learning progress, employment opportunities, and job satisfaction, and how these processes differ across socio-economic and regional contexts.

Using large-scale datasets such as PISA, RLMS-HSE, MICS, and DHS my work combines econometric modeling approaches to analyze inequalities in learning and labor market outcomes. This agenda bridges the fields of education economics, development studies, and social statistics, seeking to inform evidence-based policymaking in line with the SDG 4 and SDG 8 frameworks.

## Current Research Themes

### üéì Human Capital and Skill Formation

I study how foundational and non-cognitive skills contribute to educational progress and long-term employment outcomes. My research employs **education production functions** to estimate learning gains and the productivity of schooling systems, using cross-national data from **PISA** and related assessments.

### üíº School-to-Work Transitions

Drawing on **longitudinal data**, I examine the determinants of successful transitions from school to stable employment. My recent work focuses on the **role of non-cognitive skills** in reducing the risk of youth unemployment and NEET status, as well as their **heterogeneous returns to wages** and **job satisfaction**.

### ‚öñÔ∏è Inequality and Social Stratification

A central aspect of my research investigates how **family background, social capital, and regional disparities** shape opportunities for young people. I use **multilevel models**, **inverse probability weighting (IPW)**, and **propensity score matching (PSM)** to quantify structural inequalities and selection effects in education and employment outcomes.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Methodological Focus

I apply a combination of **micro-econometric and data-analytic methods**, including:

-   Multilevel (mixed-effects) models using `lme4`
-   Quantile regression and quantile mixed models (`lqmm`)
-   Generalized additive models (`mgcv`)
-   Inverse probability weighting (IPW) and causal inference tools
-   Counterfactual and benchmarking techniques for SDG monitoring

These tools allow me to model both **individual-level variation** and **system-level performance**, producing insights relevant for comparative education and labor market policy analysis.

## Research Vision

My overarching goal is to integrate **quantitative modeling with policy relevance** ‚Äî advancing our understanding of how education systems can nurture the full spectrum of human capabilities and promote equitable transitions into meaningful work.\
Ultimately, my work aims to inform **data-driven education and labor policies** that foster opportunity, inclusion, and well-being for young people worldwide.
