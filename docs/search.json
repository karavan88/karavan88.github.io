The United Nations is trying to highlight the damage done by widespread school closures by giving it visual representation on the grounds of U.N. headquarters in New York, and urging countries to reopen classrooms.\n\n\n\nWashington Post, March 2021\n   U.N. warns of ‘education emergency’ as millions miss school because of covid-19 closures\nMore than 168 million children around the world have missed school for nearly a year because of coronavirus restrictions, the United Nations Children’s Fund said Wednesday.\nUNICEF described the impact the shutdowns have had on school-age children as a “catastrophic education emergency” with “devastating consequences for children’s learning and well-being.”\n\n\n\nUN News, March 2021\n   Over 168 million children miss nearly a year of schooling, UNICEF says\nUNICEF unveiled ‘Pandemic Classroom’, a model classroom made up of 168 empty desks, each desk representing one million of the children living in countries where schools have been almost entirely closed, as a “solemn reminder of the classrooms in every corner of the world that remain empty”, said the agency.\n\n\n\nWashington Post, August 2020\n   At least 463 million students around the world have no access to digital or broadcast lessons, UNICEF report says\nAt least 463 million students around the world have no access to remote lessons provided by digital or broadcast means because families don’t have the ability to receive them or governments are not providing them, a new UNICEF report released Wednesday says.\n\n\n\nTableau Resources Blog, June 2020\n   How UNICEF is using data to ensure global COVID-19 school closures don’t set kids back\nCOVID-19 is challenging nearly every community and every system in place across the world. For UNICEF, the UN’s organization focused on the rights and wellbeing of children everywhere, the pandemic poses a unique threat to children and families. On top of the economic instability that COVID-19 has brought to millions of families across the world, many of the systems in place that care for children and support their well-being have been impacted."

    "text": "Cracking the Code: Do Family Ties Affect Digital Savvy Among Boys and Girls?\nAlright, buckle up! We’re diving into the riveting world of statistical conundrums with a dash of humor. Imagine we’re on a quest to unravel a mystery: Does being a boy or a girl play a role in becoming a digital ninja within the same family? Now, in the grand tapestry of social sciences, we’re aware that a smorgasbord of family dynamics — think parental jobs, education levels, whether you’re a city slicker or a country dweller, and the thickness of the wallet—plays a crucial role in skill acquisition.\nFrom this, we wade into the hypothesis pool with the idea that boys and girls, sharing the same cereal box and Wi-Fi password, shouldn’t really show a difference in their digital prowess. Why? Because gender, we argue, shouldn’t tilt the scale of opportunity to gain skills critical for conquering the employment world. Yet, here comes the twist: what if there are sneaky, unseen family dynamics at play, secretly shaping the digital destinies along gender lines? Imagine invisible forces like the societal value placed on girls’ education, old-school views on girls’ tech engagement, or even concerns over online safety—all possibly skewing the digital skillset balance.\nSo, how do we shine a statistical spotlight on this family affair to see if gender bias is sneaking around, tripping up girls in the digital domain? Enter stage left: mixed-effect models, our statistical superheroes capable of making sense of complex data with the agility of a cat. They’re particularly slick at drawing powerful conclusions from the cozy sample size of siblings sharing bunk beds and, presumably, digital devices. Let’s embark on this statistical journey, mixing a pinch of humor with a heap of methodological rigor, to find out if digital skill acquisition is truly a level playing field in the family arena."
