    "text": "The UN Global Study on Homicide 2019 Web App for Data\nExplore global and country trends in homicide and crime with this interactive web application, a pivotal part of the United Nations Global Study on Homicide 2019. Developed during my tenure as a Data Science Consultant, this app is a testament to my expertise in transforming complex data into insightful, interactive experiences.\nTechnical Tools: Built using Shiny, this app integrates intricate JavaScript based leaflet choroplet maps and engaging time-series trends crafted in Plotly, offering a seamless and dynamic user experience.\nInteractive Data Exploration: Navigate through a wealth of homicide data across different scales - from country-specific details to global overviews. The app‚Äôs ability to produce interactive graphs and dynamic tables for online exploration and data export showcases its versatility and user-friendly design.\nStatistical Sophistication: A notable feature is the use of the ImputeTS package in R, employing exponential moving average techniques for robust time-series analysis of homicide trends.\nPress on the screenshot below to access the web application on the external source."

    "text": "Hello! I‚Äôm a Data Scientist at the Data & Analytics division of the United Nations Children‚Äôs Fund (UNICEF), where I build automated data pipelines, engineer reproducible workflows, and produce robust estimates that help countries track their progress toward child-related Sustainable Development Goals. My work sits at the intersection of data engineering and applied economic research ‚Äî bringing together complex data systems to make evidence transparent and actionable.\nBeyond my work at UNICEF, my academic portfolio focuses on the human capital research, particularly how socio-emotional skills shape young people‚Äôs transitions from school to work. I study how these skills interact with education, labor market outcomes, and broader socio-economic inequalities, with a special focus on youth in developing and transition economies.\nI strongly believe that doing statistical analysis should go beyond numbers and data points; it‚Äôs about understanding the stories these numbers tell and the lives they touch.\nWelcome to my space."

    "text": "Alright, buckle up! We‚Äôre diving into the riveting world of statistical conundrums with a dash of humor. Today we are to resolve the following prediction problem: does being a boy or a girl play a role in becoming a digital ninja within the same family? Now, in the grand tapestry of social sciences, we‚Äôre aware that a smorgasbord of family dynamics ‚Äî think parental jobs, education levels, whether you‚Äôre a city slicker or a country dweller, and balance on your bank account ‚Äî plays a crucial role in skill acquisition. In other words, boys and girls sharing the same family characteristics should not show significant gaps in digital competency. Sounds logical, right? Because gender, we argue, shouldn‚Äôt tilt the scale of opportunity to gain skills critical for conquering the employment world.\nYet, here comes the twist: what if there are sneaky, unseen family dynamics at play, secretly shaping the digital inequalities along gender lines? Imagine invisible forces like opportunity costs and perceived returns on girls‚Äô education, old-school views on girls‚Äô tech engagement, or even concerns over online safety ‚Äî all possibly skewing the digital skillset balance.\nSo, how do we shine a statistical spotlight on this family affair to see if gender bias is sneaking around, tripping up girls in the digital domain? Enter stage left: mixed-effect models, our statistical superheroes capable of making sense of complex data with the agility of a cat. They‚Äôre particularly slick at drawing powerful conclusions from the cozy sample size of siblings sharing bunk beds and, presumably, digital devices. Let‚Äôs embark on this statistical journey to find out how mixed-effect models in lme4 package of R can be utilized to predict the probability difference in digital skills with respect to gender."

    "text": "My research explores the intersection of education, labor markets, and human capital formation, with a particular focus on how cognitive and non-cognitive (socio-emotional) skills shape youth outcomes during the school-to-work transition. I am especially interested in understanding the mechanisms through which skills translate into learning progress, employment opportunities, and job satisfaction, and how these processes differ across socio-economic and regional contexts.\nUsing large-scale datasets such as PISA, RLMS-HSE, MICS, and DHS my work combines econometric modeling approaches to analyze inequalities in learning and labor market outcomes. This agenda bridges the fields of education economics, development studies, and social statistics, seeking to inform evidence-based policymaking in line with the SDG 4 and SDG 8 frameworks."

I am especially interested in understanding the mechanisms through which skills translate into learning progress, employment opportunities, and job satisfaction, and how these processes differ across socio-economic and regional contexts.\nUsing large-scale datasets such as PISA, RLMS-HSE, MICS, and DHS my work combines econometric modeling approaches to analyze inequalities in learning and labor market outcomes. This agenda bridges the fields of education economics, development studies, and social statistics, seeking to inform evidence-based policymaking in line with the SDG 4 and SDG 8 frameworks."

    "text": "Current Research Themes\n\nüéì Human Capital and Skill Formation\nI study how foundational and non-cognitive skills contribute to educational progress and long-term employment outcomes. My research employs education production functions to estimate learning gains and the productivity of schooling systems, using cross-national data from PISA and related assessments.\n\n\nüíº School-to-Work Transitions\nDrawing on longitudinal data, I examine the determinants of successful transitions from school to stable employment. My recent work focuses on the role of non-cognitive skills in reducing the risk of youth unemployment and NEET status, as well as their heterogeneous returns to wages and job satisfaction.\n\n\n‚öñÔ∏è Inequality and Social Stratification\nA central aspect of my research investigates how family background, social capital, and regional disparities shape opportunities for young people. I use multilevel models, inverse probability weighting (IPW), and propensity score matching (PSM) to quantify structural inequalities and selection effects in education and employment outcomes."
